### Deployment on Flask
In this week, I have deployed a machine learning model (SVM) using the Flask Framework. As a demonstration, model help to predict the spam and ham comment of YouTube. First, I have built a machine learning model for YouTube Comments Spam Detection, then create an API for the model, using Flask, the Python micro-framework for building web applications. This API allows us to utilize predictive capabilities through HTTP requests.

### File Ingestion and schema
In this week, I took large size of data and first applied different methods of reading like Dask, Modlin, ray, and Pandas to check the computational efficiency. After that, I have applied basic validation on data columns and then validate number of columns and column name of ingested file with YAML. In the end I have writen the file (txt) in gz format and get the summary of the file.
